# Overview

This is ProjectNotif - an automated notifcation system for users to track discounts on their favourite products. The user simply adds a product URL to their account, the system will gather all the required info, and start tracking the price of that item every day. When the price is discounted, the user will receive a text message to ensure they never miss out of another deal again!
