# Overview

Project: noâ€¢tif

An automated notification system for users to track discounts on their favourite products. The user adds a product URL to their account, the system will gather all the required info, and start tracking the price of that product. When the product is discounted, the user will receive a text message. That's it, set-it-and-forget-it is the way!
